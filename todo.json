We offer many APIs which let you get all of your data, and one API in particular which lets you get all of the RAW data. The API you want to use is Live.getLastVisitsDetails and is listed here: developer.matomo.org/api-reference/reporting-api#Live You can use this API to download the data for a given website (or all websites), for given day / week / month / year (or all-time), and you can even specify a Custom Segment to filter out the data and return only the users tuiuiuiuhat match a particular criteria. If there is any data that you cannot export via our standard APIs, you may want to consider the Custom Reports premium feature which lets you create any report based on your requirements in seconds. It is our mission to help you keep full control of your data! See also: How do I make the Matomo Analytics (formerly Piwik Analytics) data available to my data warehouse? How do I set the time zone for my reports? Matomo (Piwik) lets you specify the time zone to use for each website in the Websites admin panel. Click on Administration > Websites > Edit. Note: changing the website’s timezone will only affect Reports going forward. You can also change the global timezone, so that any new website you create in the future will use your specified global timezone. Go to Administration > Measurables > Settings, and under “Default Time zone for new websites” you can specify the timezone.."
